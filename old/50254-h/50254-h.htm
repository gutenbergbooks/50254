<div class="chapter"><h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2></div>


<p>In submitting to the public the following interesting
cases illustrative of the effects of my
mode of treating diseases of the eye, I have prefixed
to them the original communications transmitted
by me to the <cite>Lancet</cite> and the <cite>Medical
Gazette</cite>. My reason for so doing is this&mdash;I
wish it to be seen by actual comparison, that in
every instance the confidence I have expressed
in the efficacy of these medicines has not been
overrated; on the contrary, it will be seen that
I have said less than the facts really warrant.</p>

<p>It will also be found, that the cases which
have come under my treatment are, without exception,
such as have been regarded either as
hopeless, or at least such as have previously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
enjoyed, without sensible benefit, all the advantages
of our best Ophthalmic Institutions. It
cannot therefore be contended, that the ordinary
treatment would have proved equally efficacious
if it had been previously tried.</p>

<p>I have also given the cases that are at present
under my treatment, in order that all who take
an interest in the subject may have ample
opportunity of watching their progress, and
forming, from their own observations, just conclusions.</p>

<p>I have also added some important observations
concerning the action of the essential oils
on the eye, as exhibited both externally and
internally.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3><a name="ACTION_OF_HYDROCYANIC_ACID_c" id="ACTION_OF_HYDROCYANIC_ACID_c">ACTION OF HYDROCYANIC ACID, &amp;c.</a><br />

<span class="xs">UPON</span><br />

<big>THE EYE</big>.</h3></div>


<p>In September, 1841, I made the following communication
to the editor of the <cite>Medical Gazette</cite>,
which he kindly inserted:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact, that the eyes of those
who have been destroyed by hydrocyanic acid
show none of the usual symptoms of dimness for
a length of time after death.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> On the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the eye is clear and the pupil much dilated.
This satisfied me that the acid exerted a specific
action upon the eye, which might be made available
as a medical agent for relieving many of the
diseases to which that organ is so subject.</p>

<p>My first experiment was undertaken in 1837,
with the diluted acid, by dipping a sponge into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
it, and rubbing it upon the forehead for the
space of a few minutes, which gave the skin a
very red appearance; but the patient experienced
not the least sense of heat, and the pupil
was slightly dilated. I continued to use this
with very beneficial effects in incipient cataract,
opacities of the cornea, inflammation, amaurosis,
iritis, &amp;c. Of late, instead of the diluted acid I
have applied the <em>vapour</em> of the concentrated acid
to the eye with much more decided effect, and
without the slightest danger. The plan I generally
adopt, is to put into an ounce-phial a
drachm of the acid, and hold it in close contact
with the eye, the eyelid being open, for the
space of about half a minute, or until such time
as the patient feels a little warmth, or the person
holding the phial sees the pupil greatly
dilated, and the vessels of the eye injected with
blood, which is the invariable effect of the application
of the acid. The patient is not sensible
of pain from this peculiar state being induced,
which appears to me to result from the power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>fully
sedative influence of the acid,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> thereby
showing that two opposite powers&mdash;to wit, the
stimulating and the sedative&mdash;are exerted at the
same time; and thereby the uneasiness arising
generally from a stimulant alone is prevented.
Its great power in removing these diseases
chiefly arises from the two powers being so
blended, and thus enabling the eye to bear a
sufficient stimulating action without injury.
The person who holds the acid to the eye should
<em>be careful not to allow the patient to smell it</em>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter"><h3 class="invisible"><a id="Action_of_Chlorocyanic_Acid"></a>Action of Chlorocyanic Acid</h3></div>
<p>The <cite>Medical Gazette</cite> and the <cite>Lancet</cite> gave
insertion to the following statement of mine,
of date Oct. 20, 1842.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In October, 1841, I gave an account of
the action of the vapour of <i>hydrocyanic acid</i> upon
diseases of the eye. Since that period I have
been engaged in investigating the action of
various other bodies on the same organ, and
under the same form.</p>

<p>One reason why I did not rest satisfied with
the effects produced by the hydrocyanic acid,
was, that its action, like that of all other
medicines, decreased in power by continued application;
thereby rendering it necessary to have
occasional recourse to other medicines, in order
to insure a more speedy recovery. Another reason
was, the reluctance of many individuals to
submit the eye to the action of so potent a
medicine.</p>

<p>The first medicines to which I shall refer, and
which I have employed with some success, are
the <i>chlorocyanic acid</i> and <i>sulphuretted chyazic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
acid</i>. The plan I pursue is that of putting a
drachm of one of the medicines into a bottle
(containing a small piece of sponge) of about
two-ounce size, having a mouth precisely fitted
to the eye, and with a ground-glass stopper.</p>

<p>The action of these medicines is very different
from that of the <i>hydrocyanic acid</i>, in as far as
they both stimulate the eye, and produce much
greater warmth and irritation, with less dilatation
of the pupil. Few, however, can bear the <i>chlorocyanic
acid</i> to be applied longer to the eye than
half a minute; though, in a minute after its
application, all irritation is removed, and the eye
feels perfectly at ease.</p>

<p>The next medicine which I have employed in
the form of vapour was the chloruret of iodine.
This medicine produces very little warmth or
uneasiness to the eye, if continued for the space
of two minutes or upwards; but a sensation of
irritation, accompanied with a flow of tears,
takes place on its removal. It contracts the
pupil, and in no case have I seen it dilate it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
Its vapour rises very readily, and does not leave
the yellow disagreeable colouring on the skin
produced by the vapour of iodine when uncombined,
which is a great drawback in the use of
iodine in diseases of the eye.</p>

<p>The last medicine which I have employed is
the bisulphuret of carbon, which is so volatile,
that the application of it to the eye, when the
bottle is held in a warm hand for a few seconds,
is as much as can be borne, in consequence of
the intense prickling heat and flow of tears
which it occasions. Owing to this fact, I generally
use it by causing the patient to shut the
eyelid during its application, which can then
be continued for a minute or two, with the
same beneficial effect upon the eye, without
inconvenience to the patient. It generally
contracts the pupil, and very seldom dilates
it.</p>

<p>I used to employ iodine by putting it into the
same bottles, and immersing it in hot water, and
in its state of vapour applying it to the eye;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
but I find it answers much better when dissolved
in the bisulphuret of carbon.</p>

<p>It is my intention, shortly, to give a full account
of the action of these medicines upon the
various forms of disease to which the eye is subject,
and also what particular disease each medicine
is best calculated to remove. At the same
time I shall state such instances of failure as
have occurred in my experience, in order that a
just estimate may be formed of the value and
importance of each medicine.</p>

<p>It may not be out of place here to state, that
I have employed, with great success, the bisulphuret
of carbon to enlarged indurated lymphatic
glands. In the first instance, I rubbed equal
quantities of the bisulphuret of carbon and alcohol
upon the parts affected, but without any
effect upon the glands. But as its effects were
so great when its vapour was confined to the
eye, I was led to apply it in the form of vapour,
and by means of glass bottles similar to those I
have described. By these means I excluded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
action of the medicine from the external air, and
thereby prevented its speedy evaporation. When
it had been applied about one minute, the patient
felt the part very cold, but immediately after a
gradual heat, accompanied with great prickling;
the heat increasing the longer the medicine was
kept in contact with the part, until it could be
no longer endured. On removing the glass, the
part was red to an extent two or three times
greater than the part enclosed. In a few days
the change in the size of the glands was very
great; and by its daily repetition, a complete
and speedy removal of the disease was effected.
I also find that its action upon diseased glands
is more decided if the surface of the skin is well
moistened with water previous to the application
of the bottle to the part.</p>

<p>The water, in fact, not only prevents the
escape of the vapour between the glass and the
skin, but assists the imbibition of the carbon;
a point of the highest importance, inasmuch as
all its action on the part depends upon the ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>clusion
of the atmosphere from the vapour. I
may here observe that these applications occasion
no injury whatever to the skin.</p>

<p>I have also found the <i>bisulphuret of carbon</i>, and
the chlorocyanic acid, valuable medicines in the
removal of deafness, depending upon a want of
nervous energy and deficiency of wax. The
mode of its application is substantially the same
as that which I employ in diseases of the eye,
with this difference only, that the bottle is formed
with a small neck and stopper adapted to the
size of the orifice of the ear, and held close to
the organ until a considerable degree of warmth
is produced.</p>

<p>The action of these medicines, which contain
so large a share of carbon, arises from the carbon
in the vapour permeating the cuticle, and coming
in contact with the oxygen in the vessels,
which is conveyed through every part of the
frame by inspiration and otherwise, and thereby
forming carbonic acid gas, which evolves heat in
the ratio of the quantity consumed by the
oxygen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>The following quotations from Professor
Liebig, in his work on "Organic Chemistry,"
sufficiently prove the correctness of this position:&mdash;"It
is only in those parts of the body to
which arterial blood, and, with it, the oxygen
absorbed in respiration, is conveyed, that heat is
produced. Hair, wool, or feathers, do not possess
an elevated temperature. This high temperature
of the animal body, or, as it may be
called, disengagement of heat, is uniformly, and
under all circumstances, the result of the combination
of a combustible substance with oxygen.
In whatever way carbon may combine with oxygen,
the act of combination cannot take place
without the disengagement of heat. We can no
longer doubt that gases of every kind, whether
soluble or insoluble in water, possess the property
of permeating animal tissues, as water penetrates
unsized paper."</p>

<p>Does not the action of medicines containing so
large a portion of carbon, which can be brought
into contact with the whole external surface of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
the body, and thereby capable of being easily
disengaged, suggest a method of relieving pulmonary
disease likely to be attended with no
ordinary success, by calling into greater activity
the action of the skin, and thereby materially
lightening the labour of the lungs? Are we not
the more encouraged to expect such remedial
influence in diseases of the lungs, from the fact
of its great power in removing indurated glands,
which are so common accompaniments of consumption?
There can be no doubt of the usefulness
of bisulphuret of carbon in skin diseases.</p>

<p>I have submitted these observations under the
conviction that they embody principles which
may be carried out, and made of great utility to
mankind.</p>

<div class="chapter"><h3 class="invisible">REMARKS ON THE <a id="ACTION_OF_CARBON"></a>ACTION OF CARBON, ETC.</h3></div>
<p>A few weeks after the appearance of the above
(Nov. 8, 1842), I wrote to the Editor of the
<cite>Literary Gazette</cite> as follows:&mdash;</p>


<p class="center">REMARKS ON THE ACTION OF CARBON, ETC.</p>

<p class="center">
(<i>To the Editor of the</i> "Literary Gazette.")</p>
<p class="right">
<small>48, Russell Square, Nov. 8, 1842</small>.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I beg leave to tender my sincerest
thanks for your kind notice in the last <cite>Gazette</cite>
of my recent discoveries on the treatment of diseases
of the eye, &amp;c. Allow me to intrude for
once in your crowded columns, by referring to
what you accidentally omitted&mdash;viz. the manner
of applying the <i>bisulphuret of carbon</i>, and also to
add a few reasons illustrative of the fact which
you have quoted from me, that its action depends
on its union with the oxygen. The plan I adopt
is this:&mdash;I put a drachm of the bisulphuret of
carbon into a two-ounce bottle; the medicine is
so volatile that the heat of the hand causes the
vapour rapidly to rise, and come into contact with
the skin. The action is more decided if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
skin is previously moistened with water; as the
water not only prevents the escape of the vapour
between the glass and the skin, but also excludes
the external air, a point of the very highest importance.
In my paper, which appeared in the
<cite>Lancet</cite>, of October 29th, I stated, that "when it
had been applied about one minute, the patient
felt the part very cold, but immediately after a
gradual heat, accompanied with great prickling;
the heat increasing the longer the medicine was
kept in contact with the part, until it could no
longer be endured. On removing the glass the
part was red, to an extent two or three times
greater than the part enclosed. These applications
occasion no injury whatever to the skin."
Showing that the action of the bisulphuret of
carbon depends on its union with the oxygen in
the blood-vessels, I will merely state the following
experiments:&mdash;Carbonic acid gas was applied
in a similar bottle, and in the same way, to
the skin, the external air being excluded, and
the skin moistened with water, for the space of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
ten minutes; but neither redness nor any sensible
heat was induced; for this satisfactory reason,
that heat is the consequence of oxidation
with the carbon, which oxidation, in the case of
carbonic acid gas, had of course been previously
effected. <i>Alcohol</i>, <i>sulphuric ether</i>, <i>nitric ether</i>, and
many other <i>ethers</i>&mdash;all of which contain a large
portion of carbon&mdash;were similarly tried, but had
no effect; for the same reason&mdash;viz. that it is
already in a state of union with oxygen in all
these highly carbonized bodies.</p>

<h4>CASE 1.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Opacity of the Cornea, the sequel of Small-pox.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">John Wright</span>, a porter, aged 23, No. 10, Bear
Yard, says that he has been nearly blind in the
right eye from small-pox, since he was two years
old. Five years since he was attacked with
violent ophthalmia, in consequence of exposure
to cold. He then applied to one of our Ophthalmic
Institutions, where he remained as an
out-patient for eight months. For the first six
months he had, thrice a week, caustic applied
to his left eye, after which black ointment for
the remainder of the time; but without receiving
benefit. He then went to another institution,
where he remained an out-patient for seven
months. The treatment here consisted in dropping
into the eye a liquid, and at other times a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
powder was shaken into it, from which he
derived no benefit. He then consulted a private
practitioner, who relieved him; but, not satisfied
with this, he went to another surgeon, who said
that the cause of his blindness was owing to a
little squint, and he submitted the eye to be
operated upon for that purpose; but no good
was derived from this operation. None of the
medical men attempted to do anything to the
right eye.</p>

<p>In September, when I first saw him, his left
eye was very much diminished in size, and the
cornea studded with white spots; the vision very
imperfect, and constantly discharging water.
The right eye was so opaque that neither iris nor
pupil was to be seen, and he could only see the

<h4>CASE 2.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Opacity of the Cornea from Inflammation.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Ann Fitzgibbons</span>, aged 13, daughter of Thos.
Fitzgibbons, 11, Stratton Mews, is a day scholar
at the Blind School, Queen Square.</p>

<p>Her father states that in infancy she lost the
left eye, owing to an attack of inflammation.
The right eye four years since became similarly
affected. She has been a patient at two Ophthalmic
Institutions, where she attended for
several months without any benefit. She was
brought to me by her father on the 1st of
October, 1842, who stated that for the last four
years she had been obliged to be led, and could
only discern the shadow and outline of objects,
but could not distinguish them.</p>

<p>On examining the left eye, I found it shut,
and all the humours lost. The right eye was
much diminished in size, and the cornea was
very opaque, excepting at the upper part, where
a small portion of light was admitted. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
bottle containing the acid was held to the left
eye as well as to the right, to ascertain what
effect would be produced. To my surprise, in
the period of a month the chambers of the eye
became partially filled with aqueous humours, to
the extent of at least half the size of a healthy
eye; the pupil was small, but the patient could
not see in the slightest degree. The right eye
has become almost transparent, and she can
now see with it sufficiently well to be able to go
anywhere. Indeed, her sight has become almost
perfect. The change is so great that many are
disposed to question the identity of the girl, and
the father is frequently asked whether the girl
is really his own daughter, whose eyes were so
disorganized.</p>

<h4>CASE 3.</h4>


<p class="center"><i>Inflammation, ending in Opacity of the Cornea in
the right eye and Staphyloma in the left.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">William Grindley</span>, aged 37, boot-maker,
formerly of 16, Whitecomb Street, Pall Mall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
East, now of St. James's Workhouse, states that
he was attacked with acute inflammation in both
eyes in 1839. He at first had the advice of
private practitioners, and subsequently went to
two different Ophthalmic Hospitals. He remained
in one eleven months, in the other fifteen.
It appears from his own account that his sufferings
were very great, for he asserts his eyes and
eye-lids were swollen very much. The treatment
consisted in bleeding, cupping on the temples,
lancing frequently the eye and eye-lids;
caustic was applied to the eyes, and seatons to
the nape of the neck; leeches. The patient had
two caustic issues in the temples; he was salivated,
and had administered to him various
potent drugs.</p>

<p>On the 9th of August he was sent to me from
the Board of St. James's Workhouse, when he
could scarcely discern light from darkness. He
said that he had been led about for the last
three years. The left eye was afflicted with
staphyloma, and was perfectly opaque. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
cornea of the right eye was covered with a dense
opacity, so much so that no appearance of iris
or pupil could be discerned through it. The
right was not so unnaturally prominent as was
the left eye. The vapour in this case was daily
applied, and the progress of cure was so rapid,
that in the course of a month he was able to
come to me from St. James's without his accustomed
guide. At Christmas he obtained permission
from the Board to be absent for a few
days for the purpose of visiting his wife and
children. It was his wish to see the faces of
those near and dear to him; for in his former
visits he could only hear them talk, for not one
glimpse of their countenances was he able to
obtain. The cornea of the right eye is rapidly
becoming transparent. The convexity of the
left eye is still considerable, but the opacity is
so far removed as to give evidence that a continuation
of the medicine will render it again
perfect, although it must take a considerable
time to effect so desirable an object.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah Hopping</span>, aged 15, daughter of Thomas
Hopping, boot-maker, 20, King Street, Drury
Lane, and of the Blind School, Queen's Square,
about nine years ago had a violent attack of inflammation
in both eyes. She was taken to an
infirmary, and remained there for many months,
where she became perfectly blind. She was
afterwards taken to two Ophthalmic Hospitals as
an out-patient&mdash;one for six months, another
three. The treatment generally was lancing
the inner eye-lids, and applying caustic to both
the eyes and temples, leeching and blistering
both the neck and temples often. The left eye
was altogether opaque, and did not show the
least appearance of either iris or pupil when
looking at it in a strong light. The right eye
appeared quite lost, for there was only in the
socket a small red tumour, about the size of a pea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>The vapour was applied, and at the present
time the opacity is so far gone that she can
see to walk alone; but there yet remains much
to be removed.</p>

<p>Her sister Elizabeth, aged 12, was similarly
affected, but the disease had not attained to the
same height. She is now almost well.</p>

<h4>CASE 5.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Case of Ophthalmia, terminating in an Opacity
of the Cornea.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">John Gadd</span>, aged 31, of 16, Little Britain,
bookbinder, states that he has been blind and
unable to guide himself for upwards of twelve
months, but for some months previously he felt
himself gradually losing the sight of his right
eye. He went to an Ophthalmic Institution, and
in two or three days he was seized with a violent
attack of ophthalmia, which he attributed to the
applications used for his recovery. He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
know the nature of the ointment inserted in his
eyes, but was told it was black ointment. In
ten days he visited another Ophthalmic Institution,
where he remained for two months. In
this institution a liquid was dropped into his
eye, leeches were applied every night for a
week, issues were inserted in the temples, carbonate
of iron was administered for six weeks,
and counter-irritants were applied to the neck.</p>

<p>From this time he became quite blind. He
then went to another Ophthalmic Institution,
where he was cupped in the temples; the eyes
were scarified, aperient medicines were given,
and lotions used. The inflammation still continued,
and he was unable to lift his head, or
allow the bandages to be taken off his forehead,
without experiencing the most excruciating pain.</p>

<p>In this state he was brought to me on the 9th
of September, 1840, when I ordered for each
eye two drops of the oil of almonds (after being
warmed) to be put into the eyes. The relief
that he experienced was so great, that he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
he felt as if he were in another world. In eight
days the pain had greatly diminished. He was
enabled to open his eye-lids, but could discern
no object whatever. I then ordered castor oil
to be dropped into each eye, for the purpose of
removing the opacity. He left me at the end
of December, at which time he could see very
imperfectly; but returned to me in January,
1843, when the opacity of the cornea still continued.
He has had, almost daily, the prussic
acid vapour applied to his eye. He is at the
present time so well that he can read the
smallest diamond print.</p>

<h4>CASE 6.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Opacity of the Cornea and Staphyloma.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Georginia Larkins</span>, aged 10, at No. 25, Grafton
Street, Newport Market, and at the Blind
School, Queen Square. Her aunt states that
this patient has been blind since she was six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
days old, in consequence of an attack of inflammation,
which gave rise to a great discharge
from the eyes. In her infancy fluids of various
kinds were injected underneath the eye-lids, and
when four months old she was taken for three
years regularly to an Ophthalmic Hospital, where
she was told that the right eye was destroyed.
The left eye had caustic applied to it for a
length of time thrice a week. Ointment was
then applied underneath the eye-lids until the
eye became so very large that she was at last
told that it was a hopeless case, and that no
more could be done for her. Her next visit
was to an eminent oculist, who said he would
not undertake the treatment of such a case.
She then went to another Ophthalmic Institution,
where she remained for about two years
without deriving any improvement in her sight;
but she was relieved from much pain.</p>

<p>I saw her first on the 6th of April, 1840,
when the appearance of the left eye seemed to
be at least twice the size of a natural eye. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
was of a dark-blue colour, standing out beyond
the lids; and where the pupil ought to have
been, there was a blue circular ring of lighter
hue than the rest of the eye, and in the centre
of this ring was a white body about the size of
a pea.</p>

<p>The right eye was quite a contrast, for it
appeared perfectly white, without the slightest
appearance of iris or pupil. The eyes were continually
rolling about in their sockets. Looking
at the little creature, I said, "What do you
expect me to do in such a fearful case?"
Without waiting for a reply, I said, "I will
endeavour to diminish the size of the eye, but
unquestionably no hope can be held out that I
can restore the use of sight."</p>

<p>I at first put, daily, a drop of castor oil into
each eye, occasionally substituting for the castor
oil the oil of almonds. This treatment in about
two months diminished much the size of both
eyes, and the opacity of the right eye greatly
decreased; so much so that a little edge of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
pupil became visible, and the child began to see,
and in four months she could walk alone.
Shortly afterwards the pupil could be distinctly
seen, and there appeared a white speck upon
the anterior capsule of the lens. She ceased to
be a patient of mine in December, 1840, but
returned in January, 1842, when the prussic
acid was daily applied to both eyes. The left
eye is diminished about one-half in size, and light
is becoming perceptible. The right has assumed
a healthy appearance; the cornea is transparent,
and there is still a spot upon the capsule, about
the size of the eighth part of the pupil. This
does not appear to impede the vision. She can
now read, with the eye, the raised letters with
great quickness. She was formerly taught to
read the letters with her fingers; she is also
learning to read common print.</p>

<p>When the child came to me I had not had
sufficient experience of the effects of the prussic
acid vapour, and I hesitated in using a remedy
of such acknowledged potency until I had, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
great care, thoroughly investigated its properties.
This I have been engaged in doing for
several years, and I am now able to state, that
in no case in which I have used it has it been
attended with any injurious effects either to the
eye or general health.</p>

<h4>CASE 7.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Staphyloma of both Eyes.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mary Ann Goodman</span>, aged 22, of St. Giles's
Workhouse, and a scholar at the Blind School,
Queen Square, fourteen years ago was attacked
with violent inflammation of both eyes. To
remove this she was subjected to very active
antiphlogistic treatment. The inflammatory
symptoms subsided, after which she was regularly
led for five years to an Ophthalmic Institution,
at which place the right eye was operated
upon five times; in addition to which she was
cupped three times and bled from the arm twice;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
caustic was applied frequently to the inside of
the eye-lids; she was also blistered behind the
ear and nape of the neck. The patient was
unable to walk about without assistance; if she
attempted to do so, she was knocked and jostled
about.</p>

<p>On the 4th of March her friends brought her
to me, to ascertain whether I could do anything
for her. I could not hold out to her any great
hope of recovery; for both eyes were affected
with staphyloma, and perfectly opaque and
studded with blue spots, and standing prominently
out beyond the lids, and having no
appearance of iris or pupil in either eye.</p>

<p>In the space of a fortnight the eye assumed a
very different appearance; each eye became
greatly diminished in size. As the opacity
cleared off, a large triangular pupil made its
appearance at the bottom of the iris in the
right eye, enabling her to see with the eye with
which, for fourteen years, she had not been
able to discern light from darkness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>The progress of cure in the left eye is fully
equal to that of the right; so that now she is
able to walk about in the crowded streets with
safety, and is intrusted to lead about two or
three other persons in the Blind School. She
can distinguish colours, and is able to perceive
large letters.</p>

<p>In such a state of disorganization as this poor
girl's eyes were in, it is unreasonable to anticipate
that she can make much greater progress.</p>

<h4>CASE 8.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Inverted Eye-lashes, with Opacity of the Cornea.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Diana Primrose</span>, aged 32, of No. 2, Benborough
Street, St. Giles's, says she had a violent
attack, eight years back, of ophthalmia in
both eyes, accompanied with great swelling and
constant discharge of matter from the eye-lids,
arising from the eye-lashes of both eyes being
turned in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>She was an out-patient to one of the Ophthalmic
Hospitals for two years, but, instead of getting
better, she became worse. She then applied
to another Ophthalmic Institution, where
she was subjected to treatment for four months,
but no improvement took place. Three years
ago her sufferings prompted her to visit a third
institution, when one of the surgeons cut off the
upper eyelid of the left eye, which gave rise to
great pain and inflammation, but the opacity was
not diminished nor the vision improved. She
was obliged, during the eight years, to have her
eye-lashes constantly pulled out.</p>

<p>She visited me on the 28th of October, 1842,
when the eye-lashes of the right eye, both above
and below, were still turned in, and rubbing
against the cornea. The eye-lids were exceedingly
red; the cornea of both eyes was nearly
opaque, and only a small portion of the pupil
could be observed through the opacity. Her
vision was so imperfect that she could do little
more than find her way about. She was often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
confined to the house for a week at a time,
through inflammation.</p>

<p>The vapour was only applied for the space of
a week, after which she could see much better.
The opacity was greatly diminished, and the eye-lashes
began to resume their proper position.
She continues to use the prussic acid vapour
three or four times a week, and at the present
time she is able to follow her occupations with
comfort, and the eye is resuming all the appearance
of health. She never has had occasion to
pull one eye-lash out since I first saw her. She
is now very comfortable, and can see tolerably
well.</p>

<p>This is the first case of the kind that I have
treated with prussic acid.</p>

<h4>CASE 9.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Conical Eye.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">William Stevens</span>, aged 25, at No. 20, Gracechurch
Street, states that he had been for several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
months at two different Ophthalmic Institutions,
where many modes of treatment were adopted to
improve his vision; but he was at length told
they could do him no good, as the disease under
which he laboured was conical eyes.</p>

<p>When I examined him, in May, 1840, I found
the right eye so prominent that it had the appearance
as if a large transparent bead had
grown from the cornea. With this eye he could
see a short distance. The conical state was not
only greater in the left eye, but there was an
opacity on the apex of the cornea. He could
see nothing with it, if the right eye were shut,
unless the objects of vision came in contact with
his face. He continued to visit me, professionally,
two or three times a week, for four months,
and had a drop or two of castor oil put into both
eyes each time. This treatment greatly diminished
the prominency of the right eye, and
lengthened the vision; but the left eye was only
slightly benefited by it, although all opacity had
been removed, and it had diminished in size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>In December last he again called upon me
and wished to know if more could not be done
for him? He said he had continued to follow
his business with the use of concave glasses, but
saw with great difficulty.</p>

<p>The vapour was employed thrice a week
for about three weeks, when his vision was restored
to its natural length. I saw him on the
21st of January, and he said he was perfectly
well, and could follow his business with great
pleasure to himself.</p>

<h4>CASE 10.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Amaurosis of the Left Eye, and Cataract of
the Right.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">George Trousdale</span>, aged 37, horse-keeper, 37,
William Street, Hampstead Road, says, that
when he was 8 years of age, a shoemaker's awl
was accidentally pushed through the right eyelid
into the eye, which gave rise to an attack of
severe inflammation in both eyes. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
inflammation subsided he found the vision of the
right eye entirely gone. The left eye became
dim in May last, and his sight was much disturbed
by floating clouds passing before the eye.
When he looked steadily at an object the vision
almost vanished. He experienced great pain in
the forehead and temple on the same side.</p>

<p>He applied to an infirmary, where he remained
as an out-patient for six weeks. He was salivated,
cupped, and leeched. He was then told
that the right eye was of no use, and they feared
the vision of the left also was destroyed.</p>

<p>He then went to an Ophthalmic Institution,
where he remained as an out-patient for seven
weeks. He was again salivated; a liquid was
dropped into his eye regularly, and he was blistered,
but no good resulted.</p>

<p>He then went to a private oculist, under
whose care he remained for six weeks. He
again was salivated; but still the sight became
more obscured, and the pains in his forehead
and temple more acute.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>I saw him first in October; he was then suffering
from severe pain in the forehead and temple.
The left eye was so blind that he could
not distinguish, even when placed close beside
it, a large bookcase. He said he could scarcely
guide himself in the street. The pupil was almost
immoveable. There was a white cataract
in the right eye, and a total want of vision.</p>

<p>He has had the vapour of the prussic acid
applied to both eyes almost daily since October.
He can now, with the left eye, read ordinary-size
print, and is free from all pain. Nearly
the upper half of the cataract of the right eye is
absorbed, and he is beginning to see with it.
This case shows the power of the acid in not
only producing absorption, but in the removal of
amaurosis at the same time. Unless the capsule
of the lens had been lacerated by the awl, I do
not think that the acid could have had any power
in causing absorption in a case of cataract
which had existed for the long period of twenty-eight
years. He is still under treatment.</p>

<h4>CASE 11.</h4>

<p class="center"><i>Cataract.</i></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Monro</span>, aged 28, at No. 16, Featherstone
Buildings, twelve years ago, had violent inflammation,
occasioned by the lash of a whip striking
the left eye, from which time he has been unable
to see more than the shadow of an object. He
says that many have advised him to submit to
an operation for cataract, but others have recommended
him not to do so as long as one eye
remained sound.</p>

<p>On the 16th of May, when he applied to me,
I tried, as an experiment, the vapour of the
prussic acid, which was employed for about three
months. At the end of that time he could see
different objects, and discern countenances,
when the other eye was closed.</p>

<p>Afterwards he went into the country, where
he remained without using any medicine. On
his return to town, on the 18th of January, 1843
he called upon me, when I found the eye was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
not improved in appearance. He is now again
under my care, and has had the vapour applied
five times. It appears to produce a very decided
effect upon the vision. In three or four
parts the cataract appears as if it had been operated
upon with a couching needle.</p>

<p>This is a case of great interest, and it is impossible
for any unprejudiced person to doubt
the great absorbent powers of prussic acid in
many diseases of the eye; but I am certain it
will not be a general remedy for lenticular cataract
(unless employed in its incipient state) without
operation, unless aided by rupturing the
capsule of the lens by the needle first. Many
are the cases where we want such a solvent
power after operations.</p>

she was taken to an Ophthalmic Hospital, where

<p>On the 16th of June the Rev. Peter Hall, of
Long Acre Chapel, brought her to me; and
when examined in a strong light, with her face
towards the window, we could not perceive the
slightest action of the pupil. Mr. Hall and I
tried her with a sheet of white paper, moving it
before her eyes several times, but she was perfectly
unconscious of it. After the eye was exposed
to the vapour of prussic acid for a short
time the pupil acted slightly when exposed to
light; and she was able, not only to see the
paper, but to take hold of it with her hand, and
could walk round the table when the left eye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>

The parents of this case were unable to say
when the blindness first developed itself. She
has always been able to see a little with the right
eye.</p>

<p>I was first consulted in this case in July, 1842,
when the right eye appeared to have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
vision. The pupil acted under a strong light,
but very sluggishly. She could observe objects
very indistinctly with the left eye.</p>

<p>The prussic acid was employed almost daily,
for three months, to both eyes. The right eye
recovered so that she can now thread her needle.
She is also learning to read.</p>

<p>Upon the pupil of the left eye the prussic acid
does not appear to have the least effect.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I have found that when
prussic acid does not dilate the eye, in amaurosis,
much good is not to be expected from its
use. In such cases I am inclined to believe that
the disease is caused by pressure upon the optic
nerve.</p>

His case has been examined by almost all the

<p>He was brought to me in May, 1840, at

<p>He has visited me since the month of April,
1842, and has had, once or twice a week, the
vapour of the prussic acid applied to his eye.
He is now so improved that he is beginning to
distinguish one object from another, and the eye
is assuming a healthy appearance. From the
progress that this boy has made the last two
months, I think it probable that the medicine
may ultimately effect much greater good.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Having, by the vapour of
prussic acid, been nearly cured by yourself of
an opacity of the cornea, which, for twenty years
past, had rendered the sight of my left eye of
little worth more than to distinguish light from
darkness; and firmly believing that, when I shall
be able to replace myself under your care, my
sight will be perfectly restored; and having
also, during my attendance at your house, witnessed
the beneficial effects of this remedy on
many other persons, the subjects of cataract,
amaurosis, staphyloma, &amp;c., I earnestly beg you
will accept this testimony of my high opinion of
its efficacy in these cases.</p>

<p>Extract from a letter of Professor Forbes, of
King's College, Aberdeen, Jan. 23rd, 1843:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I seized the first hour which I could command
after receiving your note to call on Milne,
that I might see in what state he was, as I had
not heard of him for some time. I was also
desirous of having the particulars of his case
accurately from himself.</p>

<p>"John Milne was a cooper, and in that capacity
had gone with the whale-ships to Davis's
Straits and Greenland for sixteen years.</p>

<p>"In July, 1836, he was seized with a violent
inflammation in one of his eyes, which soon
extended to the other. After two years he
became so blind that he could not walk with
safety in the streets, and after meeting with a
severe accident from his want of sight, he gave
up attempting to walk out alone.</p>

<p>"He continued for more than two years in
this state, always becoming worse and worse in
his sight. His eye-balls were covered with
ulcers; he suffered extreme pain, except when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
lying in bed with the room quite darkened; and
was at various times confined for six weeks without
being able to bear the admission of light into
his room. During the whole of this long period
he was under medical treatment by different
surgeons without deriving any benefit, but, on
the contrary, his case seemed to become daily
more hopeless. The only relief, indeed, which
he experienced was, he says, from the division
of the blood-vessels, from time to time, with
which the eye-ball was covered.</p>

<p>"In these circumstances he was brought to
you by a surgeon who had attended him, and
began, under your direction, the application of
the prussic acid vapour. This gave him immediate
relief, and in six weeks the whole ulcers
had disappeared, light was no longer troublesome
to him, and he saw quite well to go about
his business and to read.</p>

<p>"This was his state in autumn, 1841, at
which time I first saw him, and he continues
equally well down to the present date. A slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
opacity in the cornea of both eyes still remains,
and he cannot expose himself to the blaze of a
very bright day or to violent winds for a length
of time without experiencing a return of uneasiness.
He is, however, quite positive, that had
he continued under your care for a sufficient
period, he would have quite recovered; and he
has been planning a voyage to London to have
your additional advice. I discovered, however,
from him, that he has never got <em>the prussic acid
of sufficient strength</em> since you left this; for it has
never had the power of bringing on the state of
the eye which the strong acid did, and which he
found to be attended with so good effects. I
have taken means to get the acid prepared for
him of the right strength, and hope that its
application will be as efficacious as he so confidently
expects.</p>

me by George Rainy, Esq., Surgeon to the
Aberdeen Ophthalmic Institution."</p>

<p>Extracted from the <cite>Lancet</cite> of December 31st,
1842:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Prussic Acid Vapour.</span>&mdash;Mr. J. C. Atkinson,
of Romney Terrace, Westminster, in a
letter to the Editor, dated December 26th, after
a few prefatory remarks, writes on this subject
as follows:&mdash;A patient, aged 28, who had rather
a severe attack of variola last May, became,
after the recovery, subjected to staphyloma, one
of the sequelæ of that formidable complaint.
In this he was treated according to the approved
methods, both at two public institutions and by
private practitioners, for some months, without
any apparent advantage, when I was applied to;
I instantly determined on a trial of the prussic
acid vapour, having read in your able journal
an account of this new remedy some time before.
After fourteen applications the opaqueness and
prominence abated considerably, and the eye is
now very serviceable, and nearly as useful as the
sound one, no inflammation or appearance of
irritation being observable. The plan adopted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
by me was most simple: the affected eye, open,
was placed over a two-ounce phial, containing
about half an ounce of the acid, while the
patient's hand, properly directed, was to retain
it in the position that was thought necessary.
The time occupied in this operation was from
five minutes to a quarter of an hour. The eye
became in a short time inflamed, the conjunctiva
exhibiting the appearance of deep injection,
which gradually disappeared in a few hours,
but which was not accompanied by any pain.
No paralysis of any of the appendages of the
eye has resulted from the application. Such is
the outline of the case. I feel assured that this
remedy will prove a powerful auxiliary in the
hands of a surgeon-oculist."</p>

<p>Extract from the <cite>Lancet</cite>, of January 7th,
1842. Cases in which the vapour of prussic
acid was employed for the cure of Ophthalmic
disease, by Donald J. Maclean, M.D., Lic. Roy.
Col. Surg. in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>"I have been induced, for my own satisfaction,
(in consequence of some observations made by
Sir George Sinclair, who had witnessed its
effects on patients under Dr. Turnbull's care),
to give a very extended trial to the prussic acid
in cases of ophthalmic disease which might be
considered suitable for its application, and desire
that the results of some of the cases should be
submitted to the consideration of those of our
profession who may take an interest in the subject
I have, therefore, made out a report of
the following cases. In our present state of
knowledge it is impossible to explain the <i lang="la">modus
operandi</i> of the prussic acid; it will be sufficient,
meantime, to observe accurately, and merely
give the results of treatment. In what kind of
cases it will be found most suitable can only be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
determined by further inquiry and experience.
If, however, the results prove permanent, the
prussic acid must occupy a very high place
amongst our remedial agents; and, possessing
stimulant properties of a peculiar character, it
may prove useful under many circumstances
where diseases of the eye are not readily amenable
to ordinary treatment.</p>



<hr class="tb" />
<h4>"CASE 1.</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">J. Mackay Reay</span>, aged 11 years. Diffused
opacity of the cornea, the result of a
protracted attack of scrofulous ophthalmia. The
vapour of strong prussic acid was applied,
daily, for thirteen days, by exposure of the eye
to it, during which period the cornea gradually
got transparent. On the fourteenth day no remains
of former opacity existed, and the vision
of that eye was perfectly restored.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>




<h4>"CASE 2.</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Margaret Mackay</span>, Thurso, aged 12
years. Severe rheumatic ophthalmia, of three
weeks' duration. She complains of deep-seated
aching pain in the eye-ball, greatly aggravated
in the evening and through the night; no apparent
disorder of the general health. The ordinary
remedies were used, viz., leeching, blisters,
calomel, and colchicum: they appeared to give
no relief. The prussic acid was applied, daily,
for about ten days; the relief following each application
was extraordinary; the pain was trifling
for the rest of the day. At the expiration of
twelve days the intolerance of light, the injected
state of the vessels on the sclerotica, and the
other symptoms, entirely disappeared; and since
September the little patient has continued quite
free from any symptom of her former ailment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>




<h4>"CASE 3.</h4>


<p>"A girl, named <span class="smcap">Munro</span>, from Mount
Pleasant. Albugo of corneæ in both eyes, the
result of an attack of acute conjunctival ophthalmia,
which she had about two years ago,
whilst residing in Dundee, where various means
were tried for her relief. Vision was almost completely
destroyed; she could not distinguish the
outlines, form, or colours, of objects presented to
her. At her own urgent request, but without
holding out any prospect of her being benefited
by it, the prussic acid was applied, daily, for
about six weeks.</p>

<p>"11th day.&mdash;She states that she can see some
objects. The corneæ appear more transparent.
At the end of another week she was able (in the
presence of Sir George Sinclair) to state the
names of some objects, and to recognise, with
accuracy, the colours of a variety of flowers which
were presented to her in order to test the degree
of progress that had been made. She can now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
walk out and home to her own residence (a distance
of a mile and a half from Thurso) without
assistance. The improvement continues to be
progressive, and the corneæ are now comparatively
translucent.</p>



<hr class="tb" />
<h4>"CASE 4.</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Sinclair Sutherland</span>, a labourer, aged
26 years. Staphyloma of one eye, and occlusion
of pupil in the other, from effused lymph.
In the centre of this there was a small opening
which would admit the point of a fine needle.
The prussic acid was applied, daily, for about
three months. Felt great relief in the staphylomatous
eye since its application; the prominence
of cornea diminished at least one-half, and
though formerly opaque, from repeated attacks
of inflammation and ulceration, it is, at this date,
quite translucent. The effusion of lymph in the
other pupil has been disappearing gradually,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
and the pupil is now about four lines in diameter.
The patient is quite sensible of the
improvement taking place, and can now name
various objects presented to him.</p>



<hr class="tb" />
<h4>"CASE 5.</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. Alexander Macdonald</span>, jun., merchant,
Thurso, has suffered for the last six
months from an affection of the retina, characterised
by the following symptoms, viz., obscurity
of vision, excessive intolerance of light, and deep-seated
pain in the orbit. The external appearance
of the eye is quite healthy, and the motions
of the iris are natural; ascribable, he says, to
too great application to business, and night reading:
and, in many respects, the symptoms resemble
those of inflammation of the retina. The
ordinary treatment of this affection was resorted
to with some benefit, and the eye kept constantly
shaded; but the deep-seated pain con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>tinued,
and the patient was getting uneasy. The
prussic acid was applied, daily, for about six
weeks. The relief obtained was great, and at
the expiration of one month all the former distressing
symptoms had totally disappeared; but
I thought it advisable to continue the remedy
for some time longer. The patient can bear a
strong light with impunity, and exert his eyes
on any object, however minute, without uneasiness,
and is now quite well.</p>



<hr class="tb" />
<h4>"CASE 6.</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mrs. M'Kenzie</span>. Capsular cataract of
one eye, of three or four years' duration. By
way of experiment, the prussic acid was applied
for about five weeks, daily. Absorption of the
diseased structure was slowly taking place all
this time; it has now entirely disappeared, and
vision of this eye is quite restored. The result
in this case was very satisfactory.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>




<h4>"CASE 7.</h4>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Mrs. M'Beath</span>. Suffered for many years
past from a disease combining the characters
of conjunctival and sclerotic ophthalmia.
The prussic acid was applied, daily, for about
three weeks, and at the expiration of that time
the redness and angry appearance of the eye
disappeared; the organ looked clear and healthy,
and no pain whatever was felt. The patient can
bear a bright light without uneasiness, and is
now free from any symptom of her former ailment.</p>

<small>"Perth, December 31st, 1842.</small>
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;If you deem the following case of diseased
cornea, &amp;c., worthy of a place in the
<cite>Medical Gazette</cite>, I shall feel myself obliged,
while I have the honour to be, &amp;c. &amp;c.,</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">G. K. H. Paterson</span>, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p class="pi60">"Surgeon."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Case.</span>&mdash;M. J., æt. 29, of a strumous diathesis,
has been repeatedly attacked with inflammation
in both eyes alternately, accompanied with more
or less intolerance of light, and pain of head,
ever since she had small-pox, about her ninth
year: to relieve this her friends sought various
means, but without any avail, and on entering
her eighteenth year she became blind. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
catamenia had never appeared before she was
twenty; and from that period onwards, till about
four years ago, menstruation had always been
scanty, and attended with the usual symptoms
of dysmenorrhœa.</p>

<p>"On the 28th September, 1842, her eyes presented
the following state:&mdash;The right cornea
transparent, with an unusual quantity apparently
of aqueous humour on the anterior chamber, so
as to give it externally a somewhat conical
aspect; iris of a dark red colour, and its pupillary
edge contracted to the size of a pin-hole,
and in close contact with the capsule of the
lens. No vision in this eye remaining. That
of the left cornea was all but opaque, from
coagulated lymph between its layers, with the
exception of a small lucid segment, at the upper
and outer margin of its circumference; behind
which, on the eye being turned downward and
inward, the pupil could be seen contracted also,
and of an oblong shape, along with a great
increase of aqueous humour in the anterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
chamber, and the cornea, to external appearance,
much more bulged forward than that of
the right. With this eye she could only distinguish
an object when it was rolled downward
and toward the inner canthus, on being passed
between her and the light.</p>

<p>"This ill-fated woman being altogether an
object of charity, her friends solicited me to
take up her case, of which I was not at all sanguine.
However, having previously perused,
with much pleasure, a brief extract by Dr.
Turnbull, on the fumes of prussic acid as a valuable
remedy in certain diseases of the eye, I was
led to make trial of a few applications of it in
the above case, according to his method; and I
must candidly confess, that ere long I was completely
astonished on observing the rapid effect
it produced on the opaque cornea before mentioned;
more so, as the longer I cautiously and
perseveringly used it, the greater in proportion
did the inspissated lymph become absorbed, and
the layers of the cornea, over a wide space,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
begin to assume their natural transparency, as
also in dilating the pupil to a considerable
extent; so much, indeed, that before one month
under its use, she could observe objects in a very
different light, and ere another had elapsed, she
could find her way out of doors by herself, and
come to my residence for any medicine she
required; since which she has gone on gradually
to progress favourably, without any more applications,
and the vision is now sufficient to enable
her to go about free from the dread she had
before, or the use of a guide.</p>

<p>"During the use of this potent remedy, it struck
me very forcibly that the extract of belladonna
might assist the case considerably (more especially
when one had reasons for suspecting adhesions
to exist), in keeping up a greater effect
on the pupil than that arising from the use of
the acid, which every one will admit at once,
who has seen its powers depicted upon the human
eye, to be only temporary, and, I believe,
still less so in disease of the cornea and iris than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
in any other incident to such an organ. With
such an object in view, and after once applying
the extract, smeared round the eye, at bed-time,
I soon found it to be also of considerable service,
along with the daily use of the fumes of the acid,
which were both, afterwards, employed assiduously
in this manner, for the rest of the treatment.</p>

<p>"But in drawing my remarks to a close at this
time, I cannot refrain from saying less, in regard
to the utility which is likely to arise from this
medicine, when properly applied, than that, in
such a similar case as I have stated, I would not
for a moment hesitate again in giving it and the
extract of belladonna a fair trial, so convinced
am I now, after employing it pretty freely by
itself, in different affections of the same organ
(in all of which more or less improvement of
vision was manifested), of its potency to remove
many of those formidable diseases of the eye,
more especially that of the cornea, which are so
often the opprobium of our art. However, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>fore
I have done, it is but justice to ascribe this
noble discovery to Dr. Turnbull, whose indefatigable
research has not failed to find out
others, no less wonderful in their effects, as they
are useful to mankind; and for such he cannot
but claim to himself the best thanks of the profession
at large."</p>

<p>In October, 1835, a paper of mine appeared

stating the beneficial action of a concentrated
tincture of capsicum for diseases of the eye, by
rubbing it for a few minutes daily over the forehead
and temples with a sponge.</p>

<p>Soon after this I was induced to try what
effect essential oils, possessing powerful stimulating
properties, might possess in removing
amaurosis and diseases generally of the eye.
The formulæ which I use are&mdash;</p>

<p>Finding great utility to arise from the use of
the cloves and pimento, it appeared by no means
undesirable or hopeless to administer them internally
for the same complaints. In order to
shield the pungency of these oils I united them
with calcined magnesia, which, by its very strong
affinity with these essential oils, forms a body
nearly solid, and thereby removes all pungency,
warmth, and even smell; for, in this state, it
requires to be held in the mouth for a considerable
time before it produces any warmth or pungency.
They are thus rendered easily taken, in
sufficient quantity, without heat or uneasiness.</p>

<p>Some children are the subjects of many diseases
of the eye, producing blindness from opacities,
&amp;c. I ordered the same to be made into
a powder, in which form it can be taken easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
in any vehicle, without exciting disagreeable
warmth. The formulæ are&mdash;</p>

<p>The dose of these pills is one or two thrice a

<p>Expedition is required in the making of these

<p>The dose of these powders is from four to eight
grains thrice a day.</p>

<p>In the making of these powders, the oil and
the magnesia ought to be well mixed and
allowed to remain for half-an-hour, then reduce
the mass to fine powder, and keep it in glass
bottles with stoppers.</p>

<p>These medicines, by their local application,
increase the circulation, and give a greater
supply of blood to the deficient organs, and
thereby produce natural tone and power. They
are equally useful in removing chronic diseases,
where thickening and opacity have taken place,
by rousing into activity the absorbent and nervous
influence by their stimulating power.
Among many others possessing the same power,
is a concentrated tincture of pepper nigrum,
ginger, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The internal administration has been found
much more serviceable in chronic diseases of the
eye, such as opacities, &amp;c., than in amaurosis.</p>

<p>The manner of using the embrocations is, by
rubbing the forehead and temples with a sponge
saturated with the liquid. This plan alone,
kept up daily, is beneficial; but the efficacy is
more than doubled if another sponge, with warm
or cold water, is rubbed upon the forehead for a
minute afterwards. By this the energy of the
medicines in inducing a free circulation is greatly
augmented, and greater warmth is rapidly developed.
The rationale, in my opinion, is, that
the large quantity of carbon in some of the
essential oils, and its solubility in alcohol, permits
it, by the friction, to pass through the
cuticle and unite with the oxygen. As the oils
are very insoluble in water, and as the alcohol
has a strong affinity for the water, the carbon is
more readily disengaged, and forms a union with
the oxygen in the vessels, and thereby produces
heat and great activity of circulation. I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
no doubt that that is the reason why many
bodies are so pungent, when put into the
mouth. I have only given two cases&mdash;viz.,
John Plunkett and William Dale&mdash;as illustrative
of the action of the essential oils.</p>

<p>It will be seen in the following extract from
Tyrrell on the Eye, "Functional amaurosis
arises from a deficient supply of red blood."
He says&mdash;</p>

<p>"In these cases there always exists, I believe,
a want of general power and vigour of circulation
at first; but in some instances of long-continued
affection of this kind, the local circulation
never regains its proper force and fulness; and
the supply of blood is inadequate to support the
functions of the part, although the general system
recovers its natural tone and power."</p>

<p>I think this statement very correct, and therefore
the embrocations producing so much additional
circulation, point out at once the essential
oils, along with the water, as its proper remedy.
I here quote Magendie, who corroborates the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
plan which I adopt&mdash;viz., the medicines being
most useful when applied to the forehead and
temples in amaurosis:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lectures on the Physiology of the Nervous
System, delivered in 1836, in the College of
France, by Majendie."&mdash;<cite>Lancet, April 29th,
1837, page 186.</cite></p>

<p>"The integrity of both the optic and the fifth
nerves, then, is indispensably necessary for the
exercise of vision, which is lost whenever either
of these nerves is separately destroyed."</p>

<p class="center"><cite>Lancet, page 280.</cite></p>

<p>"Amaurosis cannot be considered as a simple
affection of the optic nerve; at least, in the
actual state of the science, it is generally impossible
to say that the fifth nerve has no connexion
with the loss of sight, and in many cases the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
connexity is evident. Hence a rule which I
invariably follow of addressing my remedies, in
the first instance, to some of the branches of the
frontal nerve; and I have frequently had the
satisfaction of observing some of these cases of
incomplete amaurosis improve sensibly under
the influence of therapeutic agents applied to
the fifth pair. I would go even further and
say, whenever you have a case of incipient
amaurosis, commence by acting on this nerve,
for it is at once the most expeditious and efficient
method. I cannot, however, quit this
point without assuring you that no physician is
capable of treating diseases of the eye unless
fully in possession of the facts I have just had
the honour of explaining to you. These facts
are daily becoming more numerous and more
convincing, and already a considerable number
of our younger practitioners, who devote themselves
to the study of diseases of the eye, are
fully aware of the immense influence of the fifth
pair of nerves over the exercise of vision."</p>

<p class="center"><cite>Lancet, page 281.</cite></p>

<p>"To resume, then, what I have said concerning
the sense of vision and our several experiments,
allow me once more to impress you with
the idea that sight can never be exercised in a
complete and perfect manner without a certain
influence of the fifth pair of nerves; destroy that
influence, and you destroy vision. This is all
we know upon the matter; for up to the present
moment we have been unable to determine how
far this influence extends, or in what manner it
is communicated."</p>

<p class="center"><i>Case of Amaurosis.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">John Plunkett</span>, Mermaid Gardens, Hackney,
formerly an attorney's clerk, visited me in
May, 1837, and stated that he had been blind
and obliged to be led about by his children for
the last four years. For five years previously
his sight had been gradually diminishing. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
further stated that he was much troubled with
floating images before his right eye, as well as
with clouds resembling animals, strange goblins,
and sometimes with flashes of lightning, vivid
red, changing into light blue. One great peculiarity
of this miserable man's case was, that
when he threw back his head there appeared a
stream of blood flowing from the top of the
right eye to the centre, where it formed into a
circular pool about the size of a split pea, but
ultimately it became as large as a shilling. It
often remained a considerable time, and then
diminished gradually in red streaks. This was
a matter of great alarm to him. He had been
at several Ophthalmic Institutions for nine years
previously to his visiting me. He has had electricity,
tartarate of antimony, blisters, issues,
stramonium, mercury (until it produced dysentery),
and almost every kind of treatment that
could be suggested, tried, but to no purpose.</p>

<p>When I saw him the pupil was immoveable,
and the eye dull in the anterior, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
obscure. The left eye was destroyed. He
could not discern, in a bright light, the shadow
of white paper when it was moved between him
and the light.</p>

<p>The compound embrocation of oil of cloves
was used by rubbing it upon the forehead and
temples daily, and in the space of twelve days
he was able to discern objects and could touch
them. In two months he could put his finger
through a ring when held by another person.
He continued occasionally under my care for
about a year, during which time the embrocation
was regularly used. He could walk alone,
and the eye was generally useful, but he was
not able to read with it. He could see objects
at the distance of thirty feet.</p>

<p>The last month he has visited me once or
twice a week, for the purpose of having the
prussic acid vapour applied to his eye, to ascertain
if the sight could be restored sufficiently to
enable him to follow his occupation as a clerk.
In this case an advantage has been gained. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
patient is now able to read a little, which, previously
to the use of the prussic acid vapour, he
was unable to do.</p>

<hr class="tb" />
<p class="center"><i>Amaurosis.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">William Dale</span>, boot-maker, of 14, Clarence
Gardens, Regent's Park, visited me in July,
1837. He stated, that with his right eye, for
the last year, he could only discern light from
darkness; and that for several months before
he was much troubled by clouds and spots floating
before his eyes. The evening gaslight produced
a continued flashing of light from his eye.
The light looked as if surrounded by all the colours
of the rainbow.</p>

<p>He first went to an Ophthalmic Hospital,
where he was blistered on the temple and salivated.
Nux vomica produced such an effect
upon him that all his limbs were involuntarily
twitched, so as to alarm them exceedingly. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
then left, and went to another institution
for three months; and at length was told that
the optic nerve was injured, so as to render a
restoration of vision impossible. The left eye,
when looked into, had a dark green, muddy hue,
and the pupil was exceedingly dilated and immoveable.
He was unable to distinguish an
object placed before his eyes; yet he states
that he could distinguish light from darkness.</p>

<p>When he applied to me I had the compound
embrocation of pimento applied occasionally to
the forehead and temples, by means of a friction
sponge. During the first month he was able to
discern objects and colours. The pupil acted
under the impression of light almost equal to the
good eye. It was not until this application had
been used for a year that the patient was enabled
to read with the eye.</p>

<p>I saw the patient this day (the 25th of Jan.
1843). The eye, upon examination, appeared
to be in a healthy state. The sight was not so
good as when he left me, and after he left off the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
applications, but this he attributes to the circumstance
of his general health not being good,
owing to his having suffered from intermittent
fever.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p>In January, 1834, I published the first edition
of my work upon Veratria, and gave an account
of two cases of amaurosis, combined with tic-douloureaux,
cured by the external application of
veratria. I there suggested that it was probable
that amaurosis, uncombined with tic-douloureaux,
might be removed by applications of a stimulating
nature to the branches of the fifth pair of
nerves. No notice of this suggestion having
been taken by medical men, I determined to put
the plan into execution, and employed a surgeon
to carry it into effect in St. Giles's Workhouse,
where blind cases were given me for that purpose.
I here extract the case of Eleanor M'Cartney,
for the purpose of showing the power of
capsicum when rubbed upon the forehead and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
temples. I select this case of amaurosis for
several reasons; she was the first patient on
whom I tried the efficacy of capsicum. She had
had, seven years previously, a stroke of palsy,
which removed all power of the right side. The
only power recovered was that of the right arm.
The hearing was perfectly gone; and she had
not had the least perception of sight for seven
years. It is now nearly eight years since her
recovery; and, at the present date (27th of Jan.
1843), she can read perfectly well; and has never
had another application since the three first days.
It will also satisfy the minds of many that a recovery
by stimulating applications of this description,
is not of a temporary nature.</p>

<p>I here quote the case as given in my work on
"Painful and Nervous Diseases," page 131.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Eleanor M'Cartney</span>, aged 40, an inmate
of St Giles's Workhouse, was attacked, seven
years ago, with palsy of the right side, when perception
of light and sound, in the right eye and
ear, was extinguished. There was a constant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and profuse flow of tears, and the pupil was immoveable.</p>

<p>"The treatment commenced on the 19th of
October, 1835, and was continued for three days
only. On the first day after the commencement
of the treatment there was a great abatement of
the flow of tears, and she could perceive light
and light-coloured objects. On the second day
she could see a watch, and direct her hand to it,
and distinguish the palm from the back of the
hand. On the third day she could distinguish
objects with great facility. There was no further
application of the remedy after the third
day. On the fifth day she could read a duodecimo
prayer-book with ease. On the seventh
day the flow of tears ceased, the pupil moved
readily, and her sight and hearing were perfect.
She is still an inmate of the workhouse, and may
be seen on application to the matron, Mrs.
Bailey."</p>

<p>The next case which I select from the same
work is that of <span class="smcap">Alexander Cruikshanks</span>, Esq.,
of Strathcathro Castle, Forfarshire. When
this case came under my care he was undergoing
the necessary preparation for an operation for
cataract. The peculiar difference in the removal
of cataract without operation is, that the
person afterwards needs no cataract glasses, as
will be seen from the extracts of two of Mr.
Cruikshank's letters to the author. It is now
seven years since his recovery, and he is at the
present date perfectly well.</p>

<p>"March 8th, 1836.&mdash;My right eye was affected
with dimness, or defect of vision, so long
ago as the year 1810, and commenced by the
deceptious effect of seeing two objects distinctly
where there really was but one. This deception
of double vision gradually disappeared as the
vision of the eye became imperfect. The other
eye was not affected until about four or five years
ago. The affection of this, like the other, commenced
and continued, with the double vision,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
until Dr. Turnbull's remedy was continued six
weeks, when it totally disappeared. The right
eye, by this time, was restored to such a healthy
state, that I could read 'Blackwood's Magazine,'
or the leading article of a newspaper, without
glasses, and the smallest print with them. By
the way, it may be proper to mention that it was
not till July last, 1835, that I ascertained, beyond
question, the nature of the complaint with
which I was affected. In that month I applied
to an eminent oculist, who, after two examinations,
informed me the complaint was cataract."</p>

<hr class="small" />

<p>"May the 10th, 1836.&mdash;I am favoured with
your letter of the 3rd instant, intimating that
you had heard it reported that the benefit I had
derived from your treatment of my eyes had disappeared.
The only person with whom I have had
any communication on the subject is my friend,
Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, whom I informed that the remedy
was applied to my forehead and temples, by
friction only, without your having prescribed or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
administered one grain of medicine, or having
confined me to the house, or directed the slightest
change in my former habits of living, either
as to drink or diet; and that my sight was good
enough to read, write, fish, shoot, and to see a
pin on the floor at the most distant corner of an
ordinary-sized room. What more can, or ought,
a man of 67 years of age wish for in this respect?
But if any are sceptical as to your mode
of treatment, let them produce a testimony like
this of a superior method.</p>

<p>The only other case which I intend to quote,
in order to show that the recoveries are lasting
when the essential oils have been employed, is
the case of Dr. Kent. This gentleman continues
perfectly well. It is now nearly seven years
since his recovery. He had, alternate days, rubbed
upon his forehead and temples, with the
friction sponge, the compound clove and pimento
embrocation, quoted from page 136, on "Painful
and Nervous Diseases."</p>

<p>The following case was communicated to me,
by letter, from the patient, <span class="smcap">Dr. Kent</span>, who was
for several years a physician in extensive practice
at Walsall, in Staffordshire, now residing in
Harley Street, Cavendish Square.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Thinking that an outline of
the principal features in my case might be perused
with advantage by many who take an interest
in the success of your efforts, I have sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>joined
it in as concise a form as justice to the
subject would admit. Upon my return from a
very cold ride in a violent storm of snow and
sleet, on the evening of the 29th of January, 1836,
I discovered that the sight of my right eye was
gone. In a few hours violent inflammation supervened,
and continued several weeks, in spite
of the most vigorous and energetic treatment, its
principal seat being the optic nerve, and subsequently
the iris. The inflammation was at
length overcome, but vision was not restored;
and the irritability in both eyes was so great as
to render it absolutely necessary not only to
avoid all attempts to use them, but also to exclude
them from the light. The sight of the
right eye was entirely, and, as I feared, irrecoverably
gone; its pupil contracted almost to
the size of a pin's point, and immoveable. I removed
to the country, by the advice of the professional
friends who had attended me, in the
hope that, as my general health improved, the
irritability would subside, although they gave me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
no reason to expect that the organ, originally
diseased, would ever again prove of much use to
me. In this opinion a medical gentleman of
high celebrity, in Oxford, coincided; but he
strongly recommended me to consult some of the
most eminent oculists in the Metropolis. A
much esteemed friend having mentioned your
success in the treatment of many obstinate and
almost inveterate cases, I placed myself under
your care on the 2nd of April, and had the satisfaction
to find, that after the lapse of three or
four days, a very considerable alteration was observable
in the appearance of the right eye, and
that my perception of light, and afterwards of
objects, became more distinct. The improvement
has been regularly progressing, and I am
now (the 19th of April) able to read with ease
with that eye which, only three weeks ago, could
scarce distinguish light from darkness. I may
also add, that the irritability which so long annoyed
me, ceased almost immediately after your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
first application, and I have not since been
troubled with it.</p>

<p>ON THE MEDICAL PROPERTIES OF
THE NATURAL ORDER RANUNCULACEÆ;
AND MORE PARTICULARLY ON THE
ALKALOIDS, VERATRIA, SABADILLINE,
DELPHINIA, AND ACONITINE.</p>

<p>"In our last number we expressed a hope that the experience
of others might confirm that of the author, promising
at the same time that we should communicate the result of
our own trials. It is unnecessary to assure our readers that
on this, as on every other subject of professional inquiry, our
minds have not been biased either by prejudice or partiality.
Truth and justice are ever the only guides of our conduct.</p>

<p>"We are satisfied that the medicine exerts a very peculiar
effect as a counter-irritant; it seems to differ from all others
in this respect, that its operation is confined solely to the
nerves of the part, the blood-vessels being scarcely affected.</p>

<p>"It is therefore our decided opinion that Veratria is a useful
and very potent medicine in certain nervous affections, and
that it deserves to be, and no doubt will become, an established
member of the Materia Medica."&mdash;<cite>Editorial Remarks
on Veratria, Dr. Johnson's Medico-Chirurgical Review, July,
1834.</cite></p>

<p>"I have often cured most successfully cases of Tic-Douloureux
of the face, by sprinkling small blisters, made in the
course of the affected nerves, with one or two grains of Veratria,
and repeating it every three or four days. I use the
same means, and with equal advantage, in cases of paralysis.
I need not add, that in these cases the application should be
made in the course of the facial nerve."&mdash;<cite>Majendie's Formulary,
8th edition, 1835.</cite></p>

<p>"I have now made a very considerable trial of the Veratria
ointment as an external application in gout, and with such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
share of satisfaction in its effects, that I acknowledge myself
much indebted to the work of Dr. Turnbull for the possession
of a very useful remedy.</p>

<p>"My conclusive opinion of the action of the Veratria ointment
in gout is, that we may consider it to be entirely a local
remedy. I have not detected any constitutional effects to be
produced by it in any case of gout in which I have prescribed
it. Probably the absorbents of a part affected with gout are
in a torpid state. It is no small praise of the application,
that it does not produce any inconvenient effects, and the
patient is pleased with its mode of operation."&mdash;<cite>Sir C. Scudamore's
Principles of the Treatment of Gout, 1835.</cite></p>

<p>"Veratria has, since the last year, become so important a
medicine, having been recommended first by Dr. Turnbull;
and now fairly ranking among the most salutary ingredients in
Materia Medica, it must naturally be of great interest to the
pharmaceutical and medical world to obtain so valuable a substance
in its purity."&mdash;<cite>Silliman's American Journal, April,

<p>ON THE PREPARATION AND MEDICINAL
EMPLOYMENT OF ACONITUM NAPELLUS
AND ITS ALCALOID ACONITINA.</p>

<p>"Aconitine will cure a local pain where every description
of depletive and counter-irritant has failed."&mdash;<cite>London Medical
Gazette, Nov. 5, 1836.</cite></p>

<p>"Dr. Turnbull's work will be read with great interest by
persons afflicted with neuralgia and other painful diseases.
The profession is certainly indebted to him for drawing the
attention of the public to an important, very potent, and much-neglected
class of substances."&mdash;<cite>London Medical Gazette,
April 1st, 1837.</cite></p>

<p>"As a topical remedy, aconitine is most valuable for the
relief of neuralgic and rheumatic pains. In neuralgia no
remedy, I believe, will be found equal to it. One application
of the tincture produces some amelioration, and after a few
times use it frequently happens that the patient is cured. In
some cases the benefit seems almost magical.&mdash;<cite>Pereira's Elements
of Materia Medica, vol. II., page 1808.</cite></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of the great efficacy of aconitina in neuralgic and rheumatic
affections, no one can entertain any doubt who has submitted
the remedy to trial."&mdash;<cite>Pereira's Elements of Materia
Medica, vol. II., page 1812.</cite></p>

<p><i>Aconitine, discovered by Geiger and Hesse, in Aconitum
Napellus and A. Ferox.</i>&mdash;Our knowledge of this base is very
limited. There is reason to think, from the experiments of
Dr. Turnbull, either that the plant contains two bases, or that
the aconitine of Geiger and Hesse is an <em>altered product</em>.</p>

<p>"Dr. Turnbull has succeeded in producing, but with difficulty
and in small quantity, an aconitine possessing in perfection
all the active properties of the plant. It produces <em>numbness</em>
of the <em>tongue</em> when applied to it, and is said to <em>contract
the pupil</em>, whereas Geiger's aconitine <em>dilates</em> it. In obtaining
the aconitine of Turnbull, much appears to depend on the
freshness of the plant; and the alkaloid itself is easily decomposed,
especially by alkalies.</p>

<p>"As a remedy in neuralgia and similar painful and obscure
diseases, the aconitine of Turnbull possesses most valuable
powers. Could it be obtained at a reasonable price, it would
be extensively employed. At present, however, only one
manufacturer has been able to obtain it, and that in small
quantity. The aconitine of Geiger and Hesse does not appear
to possess the same action on the system.&mdash;<cite>Turner, Leibeg,
and Gregory's Elements of Chemistry, 1842, page 1167.</cite></p>

The inspection was made the day after death. The eyes
were still glistening like those of a person alive; but the
countenance was pale and composed like one asleep. The
arteries and left cavities of the heart were empty, and the
veins and right cavities distended.&mdash;<cite>Christison on Poisons,

<p>
It appears that long after death the eye, as in Hufeland's
case, has a peculiar glistening and staring expression, so as to
render it difficult to believe that the individual is really dead;
and this appearance has been considered by Dr. Paris so remarkable,
as even alone to supply decisive evidence of poisoning
by hydrocyanic acid.&mdash;<cite>Christison on Poisons, page 711.</cite>

Numerous reports have now been made of those who have

which has indeed been considered as the most characteristic
phenomenon, and at once to point out the cause of death: the
shining, glistening, sparkling lustre of the eye has been, on
most occasions, observed. No one has, so far as I am able to
learn, attempted to explain this most striking appearance; it
has, however, been said, that those who die from the effects of
charcoal often exhibit the same unearthly lustre.&mdash;<cite>Dr. Sigmond

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
